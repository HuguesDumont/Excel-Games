# Excel-Games

These games were developed by Hugues DUMONT. You can use everything you find in these games but please give me the credits when you do so.

These games were developed in my free time, therefore, there might be some troubles in particular conditions (except for those in progress because, well, they are still in progress and may not be totally functional).

Don't hesitate to give me feedback or if you have any idea you would like to see.

And the most important, enjoy yourselves ;)
